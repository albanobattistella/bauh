- disk loader not filling all requested cached data from the disk
- Ubuntu root password check
- [Ubuntu 19.04 pip3 install issue](https://github.com/vinifmor/bauh/issues/3)

### AUR support (**arch gem**):
- Search, install, uninstall, downgrade, retrieve history and launch packages
- Faster source files downloads improving installation speed ( see **README.md** for more information )
- Automatically improves package compilations ( see **README.md** for more information )

### Code
- Code was internally modularized as: **api** (conceptual classes used to create custom software managers or **gems**), **gems** (software managers), **commons** (common classes shared among the **view** and **gems**), **view** (UI code)
- **api** allows custom operations so the **gems** can provide actions that the current GUI does not support (Snap "refresh" was refactored as a custom operation)

- the application settings are stored in **~/.config/bauh/config.json**
